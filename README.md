## What is this?
Siena Town is a shooter game in which your goal is to kill as many bandits as possible, avoid the bullets and not shoot the civilians. 
For each bandit down you get one point, for shooting the civilian or for being shot by the bandit you loose one life point (you get 3 at the beginning of the game). 


## Game Features
* Graphics on the main screen. 
* Well-functioning main menu with ‘New game’, ‘ Instructions’, ‘Credits’ and ‘Top score’ options.
* Previous scores meter with top scores saving function.
* Bandit’s bulets detection.
* Basic sound effects. 
* Bitmap manipulation (used to move the main character).
* Game Over screen.

## How to play?
Use arrows UP and DOWN to escape the bullets. When you’re in the same line as the bandit use ‘A’ to shoot. If there is no civilian in the way you score a point. But if you shoot the civilian OR the bandit shoots you, you loose one life point (one heart). 
The game ends when you loose all the life points.
